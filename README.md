## Data Science Projects [Tasks]

### Task 1: SMS Classifier

**Objective:**  
Develop a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.

**Dataset:**  
[SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/sms-spam-collection)  
This dataset contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. It is ideal for building and training a text classification model to identify spam messages.

**Description:**  
This project involves building a text classification model to identify spam messages. The dataset typically contains SMS messages labeled as either spam or non-spam. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing the text data to remove noise and standardize text formats.
- Extracting features using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Training a classification model using algorithms like logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector machines.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Task 2: Titanic Classification

**Objective:**  
Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.

**Dataset:**  
[Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)  
This dataset includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. It is commonly used for binary classification tasks to predict passenger survival.

**Description:**  
This classic data science project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset contains various features about the passengers. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between features and survival.
- Building a predictive model using algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

### Task 3: Cat and Dog Image Classifier

**Objective:**  
Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.

**Dataset:**  
[Cats vs Dogs Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fareselmenshawii/cats-vs-dogs-classification)  
This dataset contains images of cats and dogs and is used to train image classification models. It includes labeled images, making it suitable for building a model to distinguish between cats and dogs.

**Description:**  
This project involves creating a model that can classify images as either a cat or a dog. The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing the images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features from the images.
- Training the CNN using the training dataset and validating its performance on a validation dataset.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Fine-tuning the model and applying techniques such as transfer learning to improve accuracy.
